# Documentation style

## Rules

Docs describe the system as it ships on the current commit. Write in present
tense. Use active voice. Be concise: remove any sentence that does not add
information the reader needs to understand the feature, architecture, or
contract.

Strip:

- Fluff: restatement of context the reader already has, throat-clearing,
  hedging prose.
- Forward guidance: "future work," "this feature is planned."
- Roadmapping: phase tables, milestone summaries. Roadmaps belong in
  tracking issues.
- Meta-commentary: "this document explains," "the next section covers." If a
  choice needs explaining, the rationale lives in an ADR.

## Style anchors

- **Voice and tense:** [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
  Present-tense default, plain English, concision.
- **Structure:** [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/)—every doc is one of
  `tutorial`, `how-to`, `reference`, or `explanation`. Reference and how-to
  docs do not contain roadmaps or meta-commentary by construction.

## Enforcement

Vale with the `errata-ai/Google` package runs on docs touched in the current
diff via `make policy`. Install the Vale binary with `make vale-install`.

New content must pass Vale before the completion gate (Step 6) clears.
Existing docs migrate organically when touched; no bulk rewrite is required.

## Temporal context

ADRs carry the durable *why*. Release notes and the changelog carry temporal
context. Tracking issues carry roadmaps. Reference docs state the current
contract only.
